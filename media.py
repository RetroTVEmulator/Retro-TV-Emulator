# MULTI-PART MOVIE COMBINING (Part 1 / Part 2 -> one guide slot, one movie)

# Some movies ship as two separate files sharing one title, e.g.
# "Movie Name - Part 1.mp4" / "Movie Name - Part 2.mp4" (a full-length film
# split across two files/discs). These are meant to be watched as ONE movie
# start-to-finish, not two separate items a viewer could tune into mid-way —
# so they're combined into a single movie_pool entry (one guide slot, one
# combined duration, playing both files back-to-back) BEFORE random
# movie-slot selection or movie/series classification ever sees them. That
# ordering matters: a 100-minute film split into two ~50-minute parts has
# each part individually UNDER the movie-length threshold, so combining has
# to happen first for the pair to ever be classified as a movie at all
# instead of each part separately falling into the series/episode pipeline.
#
# This is DELIBERATELY narrower than "any file with 'Part 1'/'Part 2' in the
# name": a TV show's own two-part episode ("cliffhanger, part 2 next week")
# uses the exact same words but must NOT be combined — it's a completely
# normal episode that airs on its own, later, like it always has. The two
# cases are told apart by requiring ALL of:
#   1. An identical base title once the "Part N" marker is stripped — movie
#      parts share nothing else in the name (no season/episode marker).
#   2. Exactly two parts, numbered 1 and 2 — a lone "Part 1" with no
#      "Part 2" partner, or 3+ parts sharing a title, is left alone rather
#      than guessed at.
#   3. Combined duration clears the movie-length threshold — two ordinary
#      short clips that happen to say "Part 1"/"Part 2" are left alone.
#   4. NEITHER filename matches a season/episode marker (S01E05, "Season 1
#      Episode 5", "Episode 5", etc — the same patterns _natural_ep_key
#      already uses). A real TV two-parter is always tagged with one of
#      these somewhere in its filename so the show's own episode ordering
#      can find it in the first place; a standalone movie's parts never

    Pure function: the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for episode rotation order for
    the three per-day-block scheduling modes — Random Slots, One Slot, and
    Two Slots. Both the playback engine and the TV guide call this so they
    can never show/play different things again.

    (Marathon is NOT one of these modes: it doesn't reshuffle per day-block
    at all, it plays one fixed, fully-ordered 24-hour catalog on a continuous
    epoch clock. That catalog is built by build_ordered_tracks() instead —
    see get_marathon_content() in ui.py and the Marathon branch in
    calculate_slotted_playback_state() in retro_tv_emulator.py. Marathon has
    no per-episode "next up" pick at all, so episode_order_mode is meaningless
    there and the UI hides the control entirely in that mode.)

    Movies (see split_movies_and_series / is_movie_track — pure runtime
    classification, no tagging) are pulled OUT of the series rotation
    entirely, then picked and re-inserted after the series lineup is built.
    HOW MANY movies air is no longer a flat per-block cap: _movie_slot_count
    scales it off block_duration_seconds and the movie-pool/series balance —
    a pure-movie channel fills the WHOLE block (an 8-hour split-day block and
    a 24-hour Full Day block both end up reasonably full instead of both
    getting the same flat count), and a mixed channel gives movies a time
    budget proportional to how big the movie pool is relative to the series
    library on hand (100 movies + 2 series leans mostly-movies; a handful of
    movies alongside a big series library stays mostly series-driven).
    WHICH movies air, and in what order, is picked via the exact same
    shuffle-without-repeat-until-exhausted machinery series episodes use
    (_rotation_take_sequential/_rotation_take_random, tracked under the
    reserved show_pos key MOVIE_ROTATION_KEY) — respecting episode_order_mode
    ("sequential" walks the pool in a stable path-sorted order; "random"
    guarantees every movie airs once before any repeat, never twice in a row)
    exactly like a show does, so movies never just repeat the same couple of
    picks forever. Placement into the timeline (_place_movies_in_block) is
    spaced so movies are never back-to-back unless the block is movie-heavy
    or has no series content at all (see MOVIE_HEAVY_RATIO), except under
    scheduling_mode == "two_slots", which deliberately groups picks into
    back-to-back "double feature" pairs.

    episode_order_mode controls how each show's NEXT episode is picked:
      - "sequential" (default): strict next-in-line, S01E01 -> S01E02 -> ...,
        wrapping to the start once the library is exhausted. This is the
        original/only behavior before the toggle existed, so it stays the
        default for full backward compatibility with existing channels.
      - "random": picks a random episode each time, instead of following
        season/episode order — but still guarantees every episode in the
        show airs once before any of them repeat (a shuffled "cycle" that
        reshuffles once exhausted), and never picks the same episode twice
        in a row even across that cycle boundary.
      Either way, show_pos persists across calls/days so a show never resets
      or replays what it already covered — day 2 always continues from where
      day 1 left off (next-in-line for sequential, the same in-progress
      shuffled cycle — picking up wherever it left off — for random).
      Accepts either a single string (applies to every show in this block) or
      a dict of {show_name: "sequential"|"random"} with an optional
      "__default__" key, for future per-show granularity.

    show_pos is READ (not mutated in place) — a local copy is advanced and
    returned, so callers (like a guide preview that needs to peek ahead
    multiple blocks without committing real state) can decide whether to
    persist the result.

    fixed_show_order is the day-to-day POSITION template, used by ALL THREE
    scheduling modes: a list of show names giving the slot order to reuse
    instead of reshuffling via day_seed every call. Pass None (or an empty
    list) the first time a block is built for a channel — a fresh
    channel-seeded shuffle is used and returned as show_order_used so the
    caller can persist it. On every later call, pass that persisted list
    back in: shows already in it keep their exact slot, and any show name
    not yet in it (a newly added folder) is appended at the end (sorted)
    rather than reshuffling everyone else. Shows no longer present are
    simply dropped. This only affects WHICH SLOT a show occupies — which
    episode/movie plays in that slot still advances normally via
    show_pos/day_seed, so content keeps moving even though position holds
    still.

    Returns (video_tracks, new_show_pos, show_order_used). show_order_used
    is the show-name order actually used to build this block — persist it
    and pass it back in as fixed_show_order next time, for all three modes.

    """
    Pure function: the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for a block's actual playback
    timeline — every show AND every commercial break, each with its real,
    exact start_time/duration. Both calculate_slotted_playback_state
    (retro_tv_emulator.py, for live playback) and the TV guide (ui.py) call
    this exact function, so the guide can never show a show starting or
    stopping at a different moment than what actually airs.

    commercial_placement == "interrupt_half_hour": breaks are worked into
    long shows/movies (one roughly every 30 min of the show's own runtime)
    plus a final break, sized so the whole slot lands on the next :30/:00
    mark — unless the show is too short to interrupt (interrupt_floor_seconds),
    in which case only an end break is used. Each break is capped at
    max_interrupt_break_seconds (default 7 min / 420 s). Any fill time that
    can't fit within the cap is deferred and reinserted as small catch-up
    breaks (~3 min max each) between subsequent shows, keeping at least
    MIN_BREAK_GAP seconds of show content between any two breaks.
    commercial_placement == "end_of_show": one break after each show, sized
    to reach the next :30/:00 mark, capped at max_end_break_seconds (default
    10 min / 600 s). Same deferred-fill catch-up logic applies.
    Anything else (or no commercial_tracks): shows play back-to-back with
    their real, unpadded durations — no snapping at all.

        # defaults to trying to read interactive y/n prompts from it anyway --
        # a classic hang-forever trap. Without an explicit stdin redirect,
        # ffmpeg just sits there until this call's own timeout kills it,
        # meaning EVERY probe silently burned its full 60s doing nothing,
        # which is why duration-probing (running in the same worker loop,
        # right after this call) was also crawling at ~1 file/minute instead
        # of its real near-instant speed.
        # CRASH FIX: without an explicit encoding, text=True decodes
        # ffmpeg's stdout/stderr using the OS default locale codepage (on
        # Windows, cp1252). capture_output=True makes subprocess.run spin up
        # internal reader threads that decode each chunk as it streams in --
        # if ffmpeg's output contains a byte that isn't valid in that
        # codepage (e.g. non-ASCII characters in a filename or in ffmpeg's
        # own banner/metadata text), that decode blows up with a
        # UnicodeDecodeError INSIDE the reader thread, outside the reach of
        # this function's own try/except below (see crash_log.txt --
        # repeated "'charmap' codec can't decode byte ..." crashes in
        # subprocess.py's _readerthread, one per probe attempt on the
        # affected file). Explicitly decoding as UTF-8 with errors="replace"
        # makes the reader threads tolerant of any byte sequence instead of
        # crashing on the first one cp1252 can't map.
        # -t 600: cap analysis to the first 10 minutes of audio. loudnorm's
        # single-pass measurement has to decode from the start of the file
        # through wherever it stops, so on a 45-minute episode or a 2-hour
        # movie that's 4-12x more audio to decode than a typical 3-5 minute
        # song for the exact same 60s budget -- see app_log.txt/.1, where
        # timeout rate rises directly with typical file length (.mkv/.mp4
        # near-0% success, .mp3 ~12%). 10 minutes is enough to get a solid,
        # representative integrated-loudness reading for virtually anything
        # in this library (most TV episodes are already under 10 minutes of
        # DISTINCT audio content even at 45min runtime) while putting a hard

        # timeout=180 (was 60): even with the -t cap and BELOW_NORMAL
        # priority above, a probe competing with continuous live playback
        # for CPU can legitimately need more than 60s of wall-clock time to
        # get its (comparatively tiny) slice of decode done. 60s was tight
        # enough that it was timing out on almost every probe attempted
